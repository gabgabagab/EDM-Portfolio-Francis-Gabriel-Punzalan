# About Me
Hi there! I'm a first-year college student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. I have a strong passion for coding and problem-solving, and I'm constantly looking for opportunities to improve my programming skills and apply them to real-world challenges. With a solid understanding of C and a growing proficiency in Python, I'm exploring how these languages can be used in software development, process automation, and efficient data handling.

As I continue my studies, I'm eager to dive deeper into key areas such as programming, databases, and system analysis to better understand how technology drives innovation. I thrive in collaborative environments, where I can share ideas, contribute to projects, and develop my skills. Whether through coding challenges, hands-on projects, or internships, I'm always on the lookout for ways to apply what Iâ€™ve learned and stay ahead of emerging technologies.

Outside of academics, I enjoy experimenting with new coding projects, staying updated on the latest advancements in technology, and broadening my expertise in software development. My ultimate goal is to build a strong foundation in Information Systems and contribute to innovative solutions that improve efficiency and foster success in the tech industry. I'm excited for the journey ahead, and I look forward to learning, growing, and making a meaningful impact!
